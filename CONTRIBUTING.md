   the nx version in package.json

    ```bash
    nvm install <version>

## Guidelines and Best Practices

To ensure that your contributions are accepted and integrated smoothly, please adhere to the following guidelines and
best practices:

* **Follow the Style Guide**: Maintain consistency with the existing codebase by following our eslint coding style.

* **Write Tests**: Ensure that your changes are covered by tests. Write unit tests for new functionality and update
  existing tests for changes to ensure full test coverage.

* **Document Changes**: Provide clear and concise documentation for any new functionality or changes made to existing
  functionality. This includes updating README.md, adding JSDoc comments, and any other relevant documentation.

* **Keep PRs Small and Focused**: Submit separate PRs for each logical change or set of related changes. This makes it
  easier to review and merge your contributions.

* **Be Responsive**: Be responsive to feedback and comments on your PRs. Address any review comments promptly and make
  necessary adjustments to your code.

* **Respect Licensing**: Ensure that your contributions adhere to the licensing terms of the project. If you're
